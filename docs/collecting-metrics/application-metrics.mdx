# Collect Application Metrics with Netdata

Netdata collects per-second metrics from a wide variety of applications running on your systems, including web servers,
databases, message brokers, email servers, search platforms, and more. These metrics collectors are pre-installed with
every Netdata Agent and typically require no configuration. Netdata also
uses [`apps.plugin`](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/collectors/apps.plugin/README.md) to gather and visualize resource utilization per application
on Linux systems.

The `apps.plugin` inspects the Linux process tree every second, similar to `top` or `ps fax`, and collects resource
utilization data for every running process. However, Netdata goes a step further: instead of just displaying raw data,
it transforms it into easy-to-understand charts. Rather than presenting a long list of processes, Netdata categorizes
applications into meaningful groups, such as "web servers" or "databases." Each category has its own charts in the
**Applications** section of your Netdata dashboard. Additionally, there are charts for individual users and user groups
under the **Users** and **User Groups** sections.

In addition to charts, `apps.plugin` offers the **Processes** [Function](/docs//top-monitoring-netdata-functions),
which visualizes process entries in a table and allows for intuitive exploration of the processes. For more details on
how the visualization of Functions works, check out the documentation on
the [Top tab](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/top-tab).
