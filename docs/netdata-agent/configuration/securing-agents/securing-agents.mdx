# Securing Netdata Agents

By default, the Agent exposes its **local dashboard** on port `19999`. If the node has a public IP address, the dashboard and metrics are accessible to anyone at `http://NODE:19999`.

Protect your Agents by implementing any of these security measures:

**Recommended**:

- [Disable the local dashboard](#disable-the-local-dashboard): Best for users who monitor their systems through Netdata Cloud dashboards.
- [Use Netdata Parents as Web Application Firewalls](#use-netdata-parents-as-web-application-firewalls): Deploy Parent nodes as border gateways to isolate production systems from direct internet exposure, even when using Netdata Cloud.

**Alternative Approaches**:

- [Restrict dashboard access to private LAN](#restrict-dashboard-access-to-private-lan): Suitable for accessing the local dashboard via a LAN connection.
- [Configure granular access control](#configure-granular-access-control): Limit local dashboard access to specific IP addresses, such as trusted static IPs or management LAN connections.
- [Deploy a reverse proxy](#deploy-a-reverse-proxy): Secure your dashboard with password protection and TLS encryption.

## Disable the local dashboard

Secure your nodes by disabling local dashboard access while maintaining Cloud monitoring capabilities:

- Eliminates public exposure of metrics and system information.
- Maintains secure metrics viewing through Netdata Cloud via [ACLK](/docs/netdata-cloud/agent-cloud-link-aclk).

Edit the `[web]` section in `netdata.conf` using the [`edit-config`](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script:

```text
[web]
    mode = none
```

Restart your Agent to apply changes. After restart, the local dashboard (http://NODE:19999) will no longer be accessible, but all metrics remain available through Netdata Cloud.

> **Note**
>
> For Docker deployments, set `NETDATA_HEALTHCHECK_TARGET=cli` in your environment variables.

## Use Netdata Parents as Web Application Firewalls

Enhance security by deploying Parent nodes as border gateways, eliminating the need for direct internet access from production Agents. Parent nodes:

- Act as application firewalls.
- Receive metrics from Child Agents securely.
- Serve dashboard requests using local data.
- Maintain Netdata Cloud connectivity through encrypted connection.

For more information, see [Observability Centralization Points](/docs/observability-centralization-points).

## Restrict dashboard access to private LAN

Enhance security by binding the Agent to your organization's private management network interface. This limits dashboard access to your administrative LAN only.

Edit the `[web]` section in `netdata.conf` using the [`edit-config`](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script:

```text
[web]
    bind to = 10.1.1.1:19999 localhost:19999
```

The Agent supports binding to multiple IPs and ports. When using hostnames, all resolved IPs will be used (for example, `localhost` typically resolves to both `127.0.0.1` and `::1`).

<summary>More info for cloud-based installations</summary>

For cloud environments without private LAN capabilities or multi-cloud deployments, you can create a virtual management network using mesh VPN tools like `tincd` or `gvpe`. These tools enable secure, private communication between servers while allowing administration stations to access management functions across your cloud infrastructure.

For `gvpe` specifically, we maintain a [deployment tool](https://github.com/netdata/netdata-demo-site/tree/master/gvpe) that includes:

- Pre-compiled binaries for Linux and FreeBSD.
- macOS compilation script.
- Configuration templates.

We use this tool to manage our Netdata demo sites across multiple hosting providers.

## Configure granular access control

Restrict access to your local dashboard while maintaining Netdata Cloud connectivity by using [access lists](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/securing-agents/web-server-reference#access-lists).

Edit the `[web]` section in `netdata.conf` using the [`edit-config`](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script.

Use the `allow connections from` setting to permit specific IP addresses or hostnames:

```text
[web]
    # Allow only localhost connections
    allow connections from = localhost

    # Allow only from management LAN running on `10.X.X.X`
    allow connections from = 10.*

    # Allow connections only from a specific FQDN/hostname
    allow connections from = example*
```

The default setting `localhost *` allows both localhost and all external connections. You can customize this using Netdata's [simple patterns](/docs/developer-and-contributor-corner/libnetdata/simple-patterns).

While `allow connections from` globally controls access to all Netdata services, you can set specific permissions for individual features:

```text
[web]
    allow connections from = localhost *
    allow dashboard from = localhost *
    allow badges from = *
    allow streaming from = *
    allow netdata.conf from = localhost fd* 10.* 192.168.* 172.16.* 172.17.* 172.18.* 172.19.* 172.20.* 172.21.* 172.22.* 172.23.* 172.24.* 172.25.* 172.26.* 172.27.* 172.28.* 172.29.* 172.30.* 172.31.*
    allow management from = localhost
```

For additional security:

- Review detailed access list options in the [Web Server documentation](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/securing-agents/web-server-reference#access-lists).
- Consider [enabling SSL](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/securing-agents/web-server-reference#enable-httpstls-support) to encrypt local dashboard traffic (Netdata Cloud connections are always TLS-encrypted).

## Deploy a reverse proxy

Secure multiple Agents using a single authenticating web server as a reverse proxy. This provides:

- Unified access through URLs like `http://{HOST}/netdata/{NETDATA_HOSTNAME}/`.
- Single sign-on across all Agents.
- Optional TLS encryption.

We provide detailed configuration guides for popular web servers:
