# Deployment Guides

Get Netdata up and running in your infrastructure. Choose a deployment method that fits your needs.

## Quick Start

:::tip Getting Started

- **Testing Netdata?** → [Docker deployment](/docs/netdata-agent/installation/docker) (2 minutes, easy cleanup)
- **Monitoring one server?** → [Standalone installation](/docs/deployment-guides/standalone) (1 minute, upgradeable)
- **Production ready?** → [Parent-Child setup](/docs/deployment-guides/centralized) (recommended)

:::

## Deployment Methods

### Standalone

Single Netdata Agent monitoring one system. Perfect for getting started or monitoring individual servers.

**Best for:** Testing or simple single-server monitoring

**Setup time:** < 1 minute

[→ Deploy Standalone Agent](/docs/deployment-guides/standalone)

### Parent-Child Streaming (Recommended)

The recommended production setup. Stream metrics from Child Agents to centralized Parent nodes for better data persistence and resource optimization.

**Best for:** Production environments of any size, high availability requirements

**Setup time:** 10-15 minutes

[→ Deploy Parent-Child Setup](/docs/deployment-guides/centralized)

### Kubernetes

Deploy Netdata across your Kubernetes clusters with our Helm chart. Required for proper Kubernetes monitoring.

**Best for:** Kubernetes environments (required for full K8s observability)

**Setup time:** 5-10 minutes

[→ Deploy on Kubernetes](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart#netdata-helm-chart-for-kubernetes-deployments)

### Docker

Run Netdata in containers for quick testing. Note: Some features are limited compared to host installation.

**Best for:** Quick testing, ephemeral environments

**Setup time:** 2-5 minutes

[→ Deploy with Docker](/docs/netdata-agent/installation/docker)

## Which Deployment Should I Choose?

| Environment             | Recommended Method                                                                                                                                                 | Why                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Production servers**  | [Parent-Child](/docs/deployment-guides/centralized)                                                                                   | Best data persistence, resource optimization, and high availability |
| **Kubernetes**          | [Helm Chart](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart#netdata-helm-chart-for-kubernetes-deployments)                                                                   | Required for K8s API access and pod metadata collection             |
| **Testing/Development** | [Standalone](/docs/deployment-guides/standalone) or [Docker](/docs/netdata-agent/installation/docker)                                                            | Quick setup, easy to remove                                         |
| **Single server**       | [Standalone](/docs/deployment-guides/standalone) (upgrade to [Parent-Child](/docs/deployment-guides/centralized) later) | Start simple, upgrade when ready for production                     |

:::warning Important Notes

- **Kubernetes**: Always use our Helm chart. Direct host installation won't have access to K8s API for pod metadata and service discovery.
- **Docker**: Limited feature set compared to host installation. Best for testing, not recommended for production.
- **Production**: Parent-Child is recommended regardless of cluster size for better reliability and data persistence.
