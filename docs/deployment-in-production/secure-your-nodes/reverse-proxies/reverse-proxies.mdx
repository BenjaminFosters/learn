# Running Netdata behind a reverse proxy

If you need to access a Netdata agent's user interface or API in a production environment we recommend you put Netdata behind
another web server and secure access to the dashboard via SSL and user authentication. A dedicated web server also provides more robustness 
and capabilities than the Agent's internal [web server](/docs/improving-netdata---developers/web).

We have documented running behind
[nginx](/docs/deployment-in-production/secure-your-nodes/reverse-proxies/nginx),
[Apache](/docs/deployment-in-production/secure-your-nodes/reverse-proxies/apache),
[HAProxy](/docs/deployment-in-production/secure-your-nodes/reverse-proxies/haproxy),
[Lighttpd](/docs/deployment-in-production/secure-your-nodes/reverse-proxies/lighttpd-v1.4.x),
[Caddy](/docs/deployment-in-production/secure-your-nodes/reverse-proxies/caddy),
and [H2O](/docs/deployment-in-production/secure-your-nodes/reverse-proxies/h2o).
If you prefer a different web server, we suggest you follow the documentation for nginx and tell us how you did it 
 by adding your own "Running behind webserverX" document.
