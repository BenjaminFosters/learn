# Logs tab

The Logs tab is using the [`systemd` journal plugin](/docs/working-with-logs/systemd-journal), to present a structured view into your infrastructure's `systemd` logs.

We have a thorough section explaining how you can [work with logs](/docs/working-with-logs), detailing how the plugin works, and what other utilities are used under the hood to provide you with the visualizations and the log entries.

The [`systemd` journal plugin](/docs/working-with-logs/systemd-journal) documentation has information about:

- [Key features the plugin provides](/docs/working-with-logs/systemd-journal#key-features)
- [Journal sources](/docs/working-with-logs/systemd-journal#journal-sources)
- [Journal fields](/docs/working-with-logs/systemd-journal#journal-fields)
- [Full-text search](/docs/working-with-logs/systemd-journal#full-text-search)
- [Query performance](/docs/working-with-logs/systemd-journal#query-performance)
- [Performance at scale](/docs/working-with-logs/systemd-journal#performance-at-scale)

We recommend you to read through that document, to better understand how the plugin and the visualizations work.
