# Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection

Netdata provides a variety of Machine Learning features to help you troubleshoot certain scenarios that might come up.

- K-means clustering [Machine Learning models](/docs/machine-learning-and-anomaly-detection/ml-models-and-anomaly-detection) are trained to power the [Anomaly Advisor](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/anomaly-advisor-tab) on the dashboard, which allows you to identify anomalies in your infrastructure
- [Metric Correlations](/docs/machine-learning-and-anomaly-detection/metric-correlations) are possible through the dashboard using the [Two-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#Two-sample_Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test) statistical test and Volume heuristic measures
- The [Netdata Assistant](/docs/machine-learning-and-anomaly-detection/ai-powered-troubleshooting-assistant) is able to answer your prompts when it comes to troubleshooting alerts and anomalies.
