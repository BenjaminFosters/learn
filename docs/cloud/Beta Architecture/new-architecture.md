We would like to give you the opportunity to be among the first users to try our new Cloud architecture and provide feedback. 
The new architecture should offer notable improvements in reliability and stability in Netdata Cloud, 
but more importantly, it allows us to develop new features and enhanced functionality, including features and enhancements
that you have specifically requested. Features that will be developed on the new architecture include:

- Parent/Child cloud relationships
- Alert logs
- Alert management
- Much more

## Enabling the new architecture

To enable enable the new architecture, first ensure that you have installed the latest Netdata version following 
[our guide](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/get-started/). Then, send an email to [NewArchitecture@Netdata.cloud](NewArchitecture@netdata.cloud)
requesting to be included in our beta testers, and include in the body of the email a list of Space IDs you would like to have whitelisted for
the new architecture.

An administrator can retrieve the Space IDs within Netdata Cloud by clicking `Manage Space` in the left pane, selecting the
`Spaces` tab, and copying the value in the `Space Id` field. Feel free to send the Space IDs for multiple spaces to test 
the new infrastructure on each of them.

## Reporting issues

After you are set up with the new architecture, we ask that you report any issues you encounter on our 
[designated Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/847502280503590932/847812128428916746).
